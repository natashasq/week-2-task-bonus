              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
              current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
              I got every penny's worth.

            "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best - and most qrueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at VR startup."

            "Before joinging the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
            assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
            It took my learning to the next levell in a way that no tutorial
            could ever have. In fact, I've often reffered to it during
            interviews as en example of my development experience. It certainly
            helped me to land a job as full-stack developer after receivig
            multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
